## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User Input:** Accepts a password from the user.
2. **Validation Checks:** Evaluates the password based on:
   - Minimum length (8 characters)
   - Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Inclusion of digits and special characters
   - Avoidance of common patterns (e.g., "123", "password")
3. **Feedback:** Provides suggestions to improve password strength.
4. **Strength Rating:** Classifies the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
